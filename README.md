Welcome to CCMTV - Contemporary Music Television
================================================

*A brief history:*

In the early 1990's, while I was a graduate student at UC San Diego's School of Music, I met a brilliant young composer named [Arun Bharali](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arun_Bharali). Arun (now known mononymously as Petrichor) approached me in Spring of 2011 with the idea of building a web site to catalog and showcase contemporary classical music performances. In his words:

"Being at the festival it struck me as a shame that there are so many talented composers whose works may only be performed once, and even if they manage to have it filmed or recorded, it's difficult for them to expose the results to a wider audience.  My idea would be to encourage music departments to video their new music performances then upload them to youtube and make a site that indexes and rates them.  The site would also be an index of new music performers, a bit like [imdb](http://imdb.com) is for actors."

I was interested in learning Ruby on Rails, and I thought working on this project would be a good way to improve my skills. Maybe you think so too?

The project was started by [@yakloinsteak](https://github.com/yakloinsteak), who did a great job setting up the basic architecture. Preeti Gupta <guptapreeti.india@gmail.com> helped redesign the site color scheme and layout.

CCMTV has been simmering on the back burner for a while. I've enjoyed tinkering with it on and off, but since it is completely unfunded at the moment, it's been taking a back seat to my day job, music projects, and family commitments. We are currently seeking Ruby developers to help us improve the site. The hope is to get the site to a useable state, start gathering a critical mass of data, then seek crowdsource funding for further enhancements.

The code is basically functional now, but there are many improvements to be made, and bugs to be fixed. I'm sorry to say that the rspec tests have not been kept up to date as there have been many changes to the data model. The data entry process requires too many steps and needs to be streamlined. There is also a need to build out a moderation process for content editors. (Currently the "admin" role is granted to anyone who registers.) Etc., etc.

CCMTV is hosted on Amazon EC2 using Bitnami, and available at http://ccmtv.cc, or http://54.245.111.127.

Getting started
----------------

1. clone the project
2. `bundle install`
3. fire up mysql, and run the following commands:

	rake db:setup
	rake db:seed_fu
	
4. `rails s` to start the server
5. `rspec spec` to run the tests. (Many are broken. Help us fix 'em!)

Architecture

The app uses the [devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) gem for managing user accounts, and [cancan](https://github.com/ryanb/cancan) for handling authorization.
